                        Every shoot at Empire State offers a bespoke service to our clients. We make sure to craft a specific and unique experience for you, starting with a cup of coffee and an in-depth chat with our photographer. If you have any special requests or requirements, please let us know. We want to make sure we understand what you’re looking for and what makes you ‘you’ before we begin. That way, we’re sure to capture the look and feel you’re after!
                    </p>
                    <p class="md-body-1">
                        Once we’re ready to begin, you’ll have up to an hour in the studio with your photographer. We’ll use a number of different backdrops and lighting setups to create a massive variety of shots, and we’ll choose the best to put in your album. These will then be professionally edited. After a short break, you’ll be able to view the photos that day and pick the ones you like.
